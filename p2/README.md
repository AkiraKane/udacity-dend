# Project 2 - Data Modeling with Cassandra

Created a data model in Cassandra for the "Sparkify" startup to query data on user song play activity. The original data set was contained within a set of CSV files.

## Files in this project
| File name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| event_data | (Directory) contains the song play event data in CSV files |
| Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb | Jupyter notebook containing code to create, insert and query Cassandra tables |
| event_datafile_new.csv | Accumulation of data from CSV files in event_data, with columns filtered |

## Running the code
All of the CSV parsing, Cassandra table creation, table inserting, and querying is performed within the Jupyter notebook.
